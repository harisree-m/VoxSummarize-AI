# 🎙️ AI Voice Note Summarizer

🚀 An AI-powered productivity tool that converts voice notes into clear, actionable summaries using modern speech recognition and LLMs.

## 🔍 What It Does
- 🎤 Record voice notes directly in the app
- 📝 Transcribe speech into text
- 🧠 Summarize key points and action items using AI
- 🔊 (Optional) Play back the summary using text-to-speech

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🎧 Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper / AssemblyAI
- 🤖 LLMs: OpenAI GPT / Anthropic Claude
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech: Optional (gTTS / ElevenLabs)
- 🌐 Frontend: React / Flutter (optional)
- ⚙️ Backend: Python / Node.js

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- ✅ Real-world GenAI productivity use case
- 🔗 End-to-end Voice → NLP → LLM pipeline
- 📈 Highly relevant for meetings, students, and professionals
- 🧩 Modular and scalable AI architecture


## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
- Interested in improving accuracy, UI/UX, or deploying at scale
- Contributions and ideas are welcome!
