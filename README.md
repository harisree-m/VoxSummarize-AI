# 🎙️ AI Voice Note Summarizer

🚀 An AI-powered productivity tool that converts voice notes into clear, actionable summaries using modern speech recognition and LLMs.

## 🧩 Problem Statement (PS)

In daily workflows such as meetings, lectures, and personal planning, users often record voice notes to capture ideas and discussions. However, replaying long audio recordings is time-consuming, and critical action items are easy to miss. Existing solutions usually stop at transcription and fail to extract meaningful insights.

This project aims to solve this by building an AI-powered system that converts raw voice notes into concise summaries with clearly identified key points and action items, enabling faster understanding and improved productivity.

## 🔍 What It Does
- 🎤 Record voice notes directly in the app
- 📝 Transcribe speech into text
- 🧠 Summarize key points and action items using AI
- 🔊 (Optional) Play back the summary using text-to-speech

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🎧 Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper / AssemblyAI
- 🤖 LLMs: OpenAI GPT / Anthropic Claude
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech: Optional (gTTS / ElevenLabs)
- 🌐 Frontend: React / Flutter (optional)
- ⚙️ Backend: Python / Node.js

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- ✅ Real-world GenAI productivity use case
- 🔗 End-to-end Voice → NLP → LLM pipeline
- 📈 Highly relevant for meetings, students, and professionals
- 🧩 Modular and scalable AI architecture

## 📌 Resume Highlight
- Developed a voice-driven AI tool that transcribes and summarizes spoken notes using speech recognition and large language models.

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
- Interested in improving accuracy, UI/UX, or deploying at scale
- Contributions and ideas are welcome!
